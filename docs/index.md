**Connectify is a desktop application that optimises networking for your future career opportunities**. Connectify
seamlessly organizes contact details, efficiently manages your professional relationships and simplifies meeting planning.
Designed for computing undergraduates, Connectify utilizes a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
